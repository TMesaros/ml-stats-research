# Machine Learning & Statistics Research Collection

This repository contains a collection of my research papers in machine learning and statistics. The work is divided into two categories: **applied** and **theoretical**, reflecting the focus and nature of each project.

## 🧪 Applied

The `applied/` folder contains research that emphasizes **practical implementation** of statistical and machine learning techniques. These projects are driven by real-world datasets and include empirical modeling, data analysis, and predictive algorithms.

Projects:
- Predicting wine quality from physicochemical properties
- Effect of legal drinking age on crime

---

## 📐 Theoretical

The `theoretical/` folder includes work focused on **mathematical foundations**, **probabilistic modeling**, or **methodological innovation**. These papers explore theory, assumptions, or derivations that underpin algorithms and statistical inference, often without a strong reliance on real-world datasets.

Projects:
- Causality of experimental vs non-experimental studies

---

## 📚 Format & Structure

Each project folder typically includes:
- `README.md` — A summary of the project
- `paper.pdf` — The compiled final paper
- `latex/` — Source code used to generate the paper
- `code/` — Data analysis, modeling, or simulation scripts
- `data/` — Dataset used or reference to data source

Feel free to explore, cite, or contribute. This repository serves as both a portfolio and a foundation for future research.
